## Current research status

_Generated from `research_state/registry.json`; do not edit this block._

- **主方法**（当前方法代际）— 已完成 / 不支持预定主张：本代方法已完成 E0-E2 与 R 系列前置检验，但共享驱动目标未通过资格条件，当前不安排新的 VQ 阶段。
- **Token Atlas**（Atlas Statistical tier）— 未开始 / 尚未判定：Core tier 已完成；subject bootstrap、information ledger 与 train-validation uncertainty 尚未运行。
- **对比实验**（六方法联合正式 campaign）— 已完成 / 混合结论：540/540 jobs 完成且无技术失败；42 个 cell 中 22 个可带注释报告、12 个数值被拒、2 个仅 overlap track、6 个不适用。
- **Croce 验证**（新版 Synthetic Phase 1）— 未开始 / 尚未判定：新版合成可识别性与 solver recovery 验证尚未开始。

### Next steps
- **Token Atlas** — 在冻结的 T0 上运行，不生成新 VQ。
- **Croce 验证** — 按预定 decision rule 运行 Synthetic Phase 1。
- **主方法** — 如提出新的共享构念，先建立新的独立验证设计，再形成新方法代际。

Start with the [generated project status](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md),
[experiment sequencing](docs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md), and
[documentation map](docs/README.md). For manuscript work, use the
[paper evidence index](docs/PAPER_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md).

## Main entrypoints

| Need | Document |
| --- | --- |
| What is complete, running, next, or scientifically resolved? | [Generated project status](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md) |
| What depends on what? | [Experiment sequencing](docs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md) |
| What does the evidence permit us to claim? | [Method rationale](docs/METHOD_RATIONALE.md) |
| What data/mask/split contract is active? | [Data contract](docs/DATA_CONTRACT.md) |
| What code is currently runnable? | [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Where are experiment commands and outputs organized? | [Experiment workspace](experiments/README.md) |
| What results were retained? | [Results index](experiments/RESULTS_INDEX.md) |
| Which sources should feed the manuscript? | [Paper evidence index](docs/PAPER_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md) |
| How are comparisons run and admitted? | [Comparison protocol](docs/comparisons/PROTOCOL.md) |
| Which comparison sources and weights are prepared? | [Comparison asset status](comparative_methods/ASSET_STATUS.md) |
| How should a frozen tokenizer be analyzed? | [Token Physiology Atlas](docs/analysis/TOKEN_PHYSIOLOGY_ATLAS.md) |

## Repository layout

```text
src/                    reusable data, inference, tokenizer, and analysis code
tests/                  active contract, scientific-gate, and regression tests
experiments/            configs, executable workflows, active runs, archives
comparative_methods/    isolated comparison implementations and B0 assets
croce_validation/       physical-model validation and expensive legacy cache
docs/                   active contracts, status, evidence, history, literature
data/                   immutable measured data and derived caches
```

Generated payloads are ignored by Git. Active tools do not recursively search
archives, and comparison packages write only to their own run roots.

## Environment and checks

Use the repository environment; system Python is not assumed to be complete.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest --collect-only -q
```

The existing physiology-semantic launcher can replay the E0–E2-compatible
runtime:

```bash
bash experiments/scripts/launch_training_nohup.sh \
  --task physiology-semantic-tokenizer \
  --config experiments/configs/physiology_semantic_tokenizer/p2_p5_software_smoke.yaml \
  --dry-run
```

Launcher availability does not change the scientific prerequisites recorded in the
unified state. A replay should preserve the original experiment configuration; a
new method generation should define its own split and analysis plan.

Historical negative and failed results are evidence, not clutter. Large
rebuildable arrays/checkpoints may be pruned only according to
[`experiments/RESULTS_INDEX.md`](experiments/RESULTS_INDEX.md), and no directory
used by a live process may be cleaned.
