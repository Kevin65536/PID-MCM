- **主方法**（冻结边界内的主方法实现）— 未开始 / 尚未判定：主方法现只冻结九项边界：数据身份/mask/split/protected boundary、EEG/fNIRS 主路径输入所有权、连续目标先于 patch/token、teacher 非 ground truth、条件式独立 codebook 语义、observation/source 功能与证伪、endpoint-aligned increment/proper-score/null 证据内核；fine-to-coarse 保持开放，cross masking 在信息干预合同建立前未定义且不冻结。具体实现和 measured evaluation 尚未开始。
- **Token Atlas**（Atlas Statistical tier）— 未开始 / 尚未判定：Core tier 已完成；subject bootstrap、information ledger 与 train-validation uncertainty 尚未运行。
- **对比实验**（六方法联合正式 campaign）— 已完成 / 混合结论：540/540 jobs 完成且无技术失败；42 个 cell 中 22 个可带注释报告、12 个数值被拒、2 个仅 overlap track、6 个不适用。
- **Croce 验证**（新版 Synthetic Phase 1）— 未开始 / 尚未判定：新版合成可识别性与 solver recovery 验证尚未开始。

### Next steps
- **主方法** — 在九项冻结边界内建立最小版本化实现和 synthetic/software checks；坐标、teacher family、网络、是否 VQ、K/D、fine-to-coarse 与 grammar 网络保持开放。cross masking 未定义，不得进入实现或主张。protected cohort 保持关闭，不授权 measured/protected 运行。
- **Token Atlas** — 在冻结的 T0 上运行，不生成新 VQ。
- **Croce 验证** — 按预定 decision rule 运行 Synthetic Phase 1。

Start with the [generated project status](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md),
[experiment sequencing](docs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md), and
[documentation map](docs/README.md). For manuscript work, use the
[paper evidence index](docs/PAPER_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md).

## Repository layout

```text
src/                    active reusable library code
tests/                  default software and shared-contract tests
experiments/            current configs/workflows plus retained local evidence
comparative_methods/    method owners plus frozen comparison history; see its README
croce_validation/       isolated physical-model validation and derived caches
docs/                   authority map, concise contracts, and dated history
data/                   immutable measured inputs and owner-local derived caches
```

Generated payloads are ignored by Git. Active tools do not recursively search
archives, upstream mirrors, caches, checkpoints, or run trees, and comparison
packages write only to their own run roots. Frozen paths stay in place when reports
or hashes depend on them; directory cleanup is versioned rather than hidden behind
compatibility layers.

## Environment and checks

Use the repository environment; system Python is not assumed to be complete.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest --collect-only -q
```

There is no forward-method training launcher yet. A new implementation must own
its versioned config, synthetic checks, split contract, and output namespace rather
than repurposing an E0–E2 entrypoint.

Superseded code, configs, tests, plans, and local runs were moved to one
Git-ignored archive generation. Frozen evidence paths and the retained surfaces in
[`experiments/RESULTS_INDEX.md`](experiments/RESULTS_INDEX.md) remain in place;
no directory used by a live process may be cleaned.
