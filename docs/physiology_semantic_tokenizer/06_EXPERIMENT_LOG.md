# Physiology-semantic tokenizer experiment log

_Active run registry for experiments executed under the 2026-07-01 target contract_

---

## 📋 Current status

No tokenizer training run has yet been promoted under the new architecture. P1 implementation has started: the versioned paired-optical cache/teacher contract passed its real-data dry-run and smoke checks. G0 remains unevaluated because posterior-predictive validity, observability, calibration, and preregistered coverage have not yet been tested.

## 🚦 Admission rule

A result is added here only when it has:

1. a run or suite manifest under the active result root;
2. an immutable resolved configuration and split hash;
3. a declared primary endpoint from [`05_EXPERIMENT_DESIGN.md`](05_EXPERIMENT_DESIGN.md);
4. a versioned `decision_protocol.yaml`, `metric_registry.json`, and `evidence_calibration.json`;
5. a completion status that distinguishes smoke, short-formal, and full-formal evidence;
6. a link to the run-level summary rather than only a pooled suite report.

## 🗂️ Historical results

All source/observation, coupling-strengthening, exchange, alignment, and old downstream results were moved to:

```text
experiments/archive/pre_physiology_semantic_20260701/runs/
```

Their narrative log is preserved at [`source_observation/EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`](../archive/pre_physiology_semantic_20260701/source_observation/EXPERIMENT_LOG.md). Historical results are baseline evidence and never appear in this table.
