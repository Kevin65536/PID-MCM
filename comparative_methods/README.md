# Comparison methods

This tree contains comparison-method integrations, compact protocol/evidence files,
and local generated assets. It also retains the frozen 2026 public matrices and joint
protected campaign at their original paths so their hashes remain auditable. Those
historical control files are not the workflow for ordinary new development.

Current execution and scientific verdicts come only from the generated
[`PROJECT_STATUS.md`](../docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md#对比实验). Do not infer current work,
authorization, or next actions from a method README, launch YAML, candidate, run
directory, or signed campaign artifact.

## Start here

Read only what the task needs:

1. [`docs/comparisons/PROTOCOL.md`](../docs/comparisons/PROTOCOL.md) — shared data,
   split, task, metric, and protected-evaluation contract;
2. [`docs/comparisons/METRIC_ACCEPTANCE.md`](../docs/comparisons/METRIC_ACCEPTANCE.md)
   — rules for admitting a numeric result;
3. for adapter changes, [`ADAPTER_ALIGNMENT_GATES_V2.md`](ADAPTER_ALIGNMENT_GATES_V2.md),
   its [`machine contract`](adapter_alignment_gate_contract_v2.yaml), and
   [`metric targets`](comparison_metric_targets_v1.yaml);
4. the target method's `README.md`, `sources/method_manifest.yaml`, active config,
   implementation, and tests;
5. for the completed 2026 results only, the dated
   [`PROTECTED_CAMPAIGN_RESULTS_20260814.md`](../docs/comparisons/PROTECTED_CAMPAIGN_RESULTS_20260814.md).

Local ignored release candidates, authorization records, ORR files, predictions,
and job statuses are optional historical evidence. They are never prerequisites for
understanding the repository or starting public-surface code work.

## Directory map

| Path | Role | Default treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BIOT/`, `CBraMod/`, `REVE/` | EEG-only method owners | active method-local code |
| `NormWear/`, `EFRM-PyTorch/`, `BrainFusion-NVC-CSP-Stacking/` | multimodal/adapted method owners | active method-local code |
| `STA-Net-PyTorch/` | independent retained implementation and frozen result | change only for an explicit STA-Net task |
| `performance_analysis/` | cross-method descriptive analysis | analysis only; never an execution authority |
| `single_modal_eeg/` | early shared BIOT/CBraMod/REVE runner | compatibility only; no new features |
| `STA-Net/`, `EFRM-A-*/`, `*/upstream/` | local upstream source mirrors | ignored, read only when source fidelity requires it |
| `*/checkpoints/`, `*/runs/`, root `runs/` | model and run payloads | generated/ignored; do not scan by default |
| `*/evidence/`, root `evidence/` | compact summaries plus local protected evidence | read a named final summary, not the whole tree |
| root campaign `*.py` files | frozen 2026 joint control plane | historical/read-only unless a new versioned campaign is requested |

The physical paths above are retained because configs, reports, tests, and source
hashes refer to them. Future cleanup must use a versioned migration; adding wrappers
or moving the frozen v2 files merely for appearance would increase complexity.

## Method-local shape

New comparison work belongs to one method owner:

```text
comparative_methods/<method>/
├── README.md             # identity, supported surface, local entrypoints
├── sources/              # upstream revision and source-fidelity record
├── configs/              # data/protocol/runtime configuration
├── adapters/ or package/ # method-specific implementation
├── tests/                # adapter and method-specific tests
├── evidence/             # compact reviewed summaries only
├── checkpoints/          # local binaries; ignored
├── runs/                 # local generated outputs; ignored
└── upstream/             # local pinned checkout; ignored
```

Do not add a second status file, generic results root, method-local authorization
service, or another top-level runner. Reusable public path/task/metric invariants
belong in one small shared helper; model and training differences remain local.
Methods must not import implementation details from another method.

## Public and protected work

Public-surface development is ordinary work and creates no authorization artifact.
Protected evaluation is a separate transition owned by one protocol/controller; a
prior GO never carries forward. The existing v2 flags remain historical schema and
must not be copied into new work.

Scheduling, runtime attestation, and schema rules belong to the owning
protocol/controller, not to method-local authorization copies.

## Evidence and tests

For each method, prefer `evidence/alignment_v2/summary_final.json` and the reviewed
matrix completion summary over intermediate `summary.json`, pilot, or partial files.
The intermediate files remain only where frozen configs still hash or consume them.

The repository's default `pytest.ini` does not collect method-local test directories.
Run the owner suite explicitly after changing a method, for example:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q comparative_methods/BIOT/tests
```

Run different method suites in separate pytest processes because some historical
packages use overlapping top-level module names. The joint protected evidence suite
depends on local sealed artifacts and is not an orientation check; use a temporary,
non-authorizing fixture where possible and never alter a workspace signing record
merely to make it pass.

## Historical material and local assets

[`EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md`](EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md) and
[`ROUND_ARTIFACTS_20260812.md`](ROUND_ARTIFACTS_20260812.md) are dated historical
snapshots, not current queues or permission records. Source and weight provenance is
indexed by [`ASSET_STATUS.md`](ASSET_STATUS.md).

Git tracks controlled source, contracts, tests, manifests, compact summaries, and
the dated human-readable result report. Upstream checkouts, weights, feature caches,
large runs, protected predictions, and named signing records stay local. Do not add
new `.gitignore` allowlist entries for source code; generated files must use the
existing owner-local ignored paths.
